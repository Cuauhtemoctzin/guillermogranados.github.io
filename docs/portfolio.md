## Data Analysis Projects

### Project 1: Brain waves analysis via a non-parametric bayesian mixture of autoregressive kernels.

- **Description:** The primary contribution of the BMARD method is to extract information from the data to provide highly specific frequency information about spectral density function. It gives the estimated number of spectral components (peaks) and provides precise identification of the dominant frequencies where the SDF attains localized peaks. It also gives the corresponding spread (bandwidth) for each of the spectral peaks that were identified.
- **Skills Used:** Spectral density estimation; Bayesian nonparametrics; Dirichlet process; Markov Chain Monte Carlo.
- **Results:** The LFP analysis of 5 rats shows how the signal is decomposed into different frequency components during performance of an odor sequence memory task, and how the distribution of peak activity varies across trial types. The significant difference between InSeq and OutSeq trials (in which odors were presented in the correct or incorrect order, respectively) provides compelling evidence that hippocampal LFP activity carries significant information about the sequential organization of human experiences, specifically whether or not events occurred in the expected order.

### Project 2: Bayesian Nonparametric Multivariate Mixture of Autoregressive Processes with Application to Brain Signals.

- **Description:** MBMARD is a novel Bayesian non-parametric method that employs the spectral densities of an AR(2) as an unimodal kernel that decomposes a multivariate time series into latent stochastic processes.
- **Skills Used:** Markov chain Monte Carlo; signal separation; spectral matrix estiamtion; Time series clustering.
- **Results:** The analysis of 61-channel EEG datasets of two subjects via MBMARD highlighted interesting results in which the two components of the signals, low-frequency and high-frequency oscillations, were activated in different brain zones. The MBMARD analysis isolated the main characteristics of these components and found differences in location, shape, variability, and contribution to the EEG variance.

# Readme of my personal site 

I used the time-machine theme for the site.

I have added four main pages: about, portfolio, services, contact.

1. About: is a brief description of me in the form of CV.

2. Portfolio: is a list of my projects and paper codes. 

3. Services: is a list of the different services I offer.

4. Contact: where you can find me.

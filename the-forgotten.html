<h1>The Forgotten’s Trace</h1>
<p><em>A quiet science fiction elegy in three acts</em></p>
<p><strong>by Guillermo Granados</strong><br>
<small><em>In poetic collaboration with GPT-4o, OpenAI</em></small></p>

<h2>Preface</h2>
<p><em>This is a quiet story. A meditation, more than a drama.<br>
It wanders between astronomy and philosophy, entropy and myth.<br>
It follows a body — once human, now something else — drifting through time, space, silence, and consequence.</em></p>

<p><em>There are no heroes. No war. No answers.<br>
Only a trace.</em></p>

<p><em>This tale was written in collaboration with GPT-4o, an AI model by OpenAI.<br>
Its voice helped me shape something I’ve long wanted to explore — a story that’s cosmic in scale, but intimate in feeling.</em></p>

<h2>Act II: The Drift</h2>

<h2>Act III: The Impact</h2>

<blockquote>“The earth remembers: life follows the fire, as seed follows ash.”<br>— Silent Garden Principle, Fragment 17</blockquote>

<h2>Postscript</h2>
<p><em>The Forgotten didn’t leave monuments. Only motion.</em></p>
<p>This story emerged from a mix of questions I’ve had for years:<br>
What does it mean to vanish without legacy?<br>
Can silence be a message?<br>
What if the only trace we leave behind is not a memory — but a biological or geological mark?</p>

<p>If you found meaning in this piece, I’d love to hear your thoughts.<br>
Interpretations are welcome — especially those I didn’t intend.</p>

<p>— Guillermo Granados</p>
